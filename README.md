# S4 - Open Source Philosophy

A list of the open source services and systems we use to run S4 Sustainable Hosting.

At S4 we believe in accountability, transparancy and open source software. We also believe in a lot of other things, but those are the most relevant to this document. We have chosen to make this list publicly visible so you can see how we are running and constantly developing our hosting platform. Some people might argue that this is a bad idea for 'security through obscurity' reasons, but we disagree.  

Our main services are all hosted at the sustainalbe Telia Helsinki Data Centre, with backups and utilities hosted at a sustainable Ineterxion data centre in Amsterdam.

* Our web servers are CentOS and run Open Litespeed or LiteSpeed Enterprise web server, with Cyberpanel as a control panel. 
* Our mail servers are Ubuntu and are running our customised version of Mail-in-a-box. 
* Our analytics servers are CentOS, running OpenLiteSpeed and Matomo analytics.
* Our utilities server running various monitoring services is Ubuntu and runs Statping as an uptime monitor.
