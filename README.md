# S4-Changelog

Changelog for the services and systems we use to run S4 Sustainable Hosting

At S4 we believe in accountability, transparancy and open source software. We also believe in a lot of other things, but those are the most relevant to this document. We have chosen to make this changelog publicly visible so you can see how we are running and constantly developing our hosting platform. 

Our web servers are CentOS and run LiteSpeed Enterprise web server, with Cyberpanel as a control panel. 

Our mail servers are Ubuntu and are running our customised version of Mail-in-a-box.
